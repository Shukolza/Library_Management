2. **Clone** your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Library_Management.git`
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git switch -c feat/your-feature-name` or `git switch -c fix/your-bug-fix`. Please use descriptive branch names.
4. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear commit messages.
5. **Push** your changes to your fork: `git push -u origin feat/your-feature-name`

## Branchgig strategy

* The `main` branch is the primary development branch and should always be stable.
* All development work (new features, bug fixes) must be done in separate branches.
* Pull Requests should be made against the `main` branch.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/Shukolza/Library_Management/issues) and provide as much detail as possible, including:

* Steps to reproduce the bug.
* Expected behavior.
* Actual behavior.
* Screenshots (if applicable).
* The `(part_name)_log.txt` file (or logs for other components when they are added).
